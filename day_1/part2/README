Solving this requires the reuse of idea from part 1.

Steps:
1. We calculate the fuel required by taking a cummulitative sum of values by dividing by 3 (floor) and subtract by 2.
	insert his fuel mass to an array if the value is positive ( > 0 only ) 
2. The values calculated in step 1 will be stored in an array and repeat step 1 on this new array of values. Go to step 3 if array size is 0

3. The solution is the cummulitaive sum so far
