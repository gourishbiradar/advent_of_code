Solving this is like writing an emulator with a very very small set of opcodes

1 for addition 
2 for multiplication
99 for return
any other integer passed as opcode arguments are vector positions ( program is stored as vector of integers)

We can read the input file and store in a vector of integers,
pass the vector to an emulator to run through program
return the program as vector of integers.

The driver function (in our case main ) will return the value at position 0 as the required answer
