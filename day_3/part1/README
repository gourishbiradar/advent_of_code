Solving this would require maintaining a map of tuples (x,y) and set with with 1 or 0 for intersection points meeting or not.

Using manhantan distance find the closest intersection point from the central port, we should do this while building the grid itself to avoid multiple loops

O(n*n)


implementation : works (kinda... bad coding practices)
